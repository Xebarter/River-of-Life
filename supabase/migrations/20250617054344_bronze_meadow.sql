  # Fix Storage Policies for Gallery Upload

  1. Storage Policies
    - Drop existing conflicting policies
    - Create proper policies for gallery bucket uploads
    - Ensure authenticated users can upload to gallery bucket
    - Allow public read access to gallery files

  2. Security
    - Maintain admin-only upload access
    - Public read access for gallery images
